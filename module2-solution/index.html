					<p id="f">Flute</p>
					<p>The bamboo flute is an important instrument in Indian classical music and is developed independently of the Western flute.The Indian flutes are very simple when compared to the Western counterparts as they are made of single reed of bamboo and are keyless.There are two main varieties of Indian flutes that are currently used. The first, the Bansuri, has six finger holes and one embouchure hole, and is used predominantly in the Hindustani music of Northern India. The second, the Venu, has eight finger holes, and is played predominantly in the Carnatic music of Southern India. Presently, the eight-holed flute with cross-fingering technique is common among many Carnatic flutists. Prior to this, the South Indian flute had only seven finger holes, at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

					<p id="v">Veena</p>
					<p>The Veena is a plucked stringed instrument originating in ancient India, used mainly in Carnatic classical music and Hindustani classical music. The name is used for several instruments belonging to different families, mainly the Rudra Veena (a zither) and the Saraswati veena (a necked bowl lute) but also to other types of plucked string instruments.The earliest Veena was an instrument of the harp type whose type survives in the Burmese harp, whereas in the last centuries and nowadays, the word has tended to be applied to instruments of the lute type or even, recently, to certain kinds of guitars developed in India. The more popular sitar is believed to have been derived from a type of Veena which was modified by a Mughal court musician to conform with the tastes of his Persian patrons.</p>

					<p id="t">Tabla</p>
					<p>The tabla is a membranophone percussion instrument (similar to bongos) which is often used in Hindustani classical music and in the traditional music of India. The instrument consists of a pair of hand drums of contrasting sizes and timbres.The main drum called a tabla is played with the dominant hand. Its shell is cylindrical and made out of wood, and its tight skin produces a distinct pitch when struck. The larger, low pitched drum, has a bowl-shaped metal shell. Its membrane is looser than that of the tabla, enabling the player to manipulate the drum's pitch with his or her hand in performance. The playing technique is complex and involves extensive use of the fingers and palms in various configurations to create a wide variety of different sounds and rhythms, reflected in mnemonic syllables.</p>
